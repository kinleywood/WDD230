      <h2>Site Name:</h2>
      <p>Temple Inn & Suites</p>
      <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
      <p>We are a hotel chain dedicated to making your temple trips as easy as possible! We build and manage hotels near temples all over the world. We provide special services and accommodations to works, patrons, and their families. We want this website to be easy to navigate and have a consistent temple theme. This website will be responsive in small, medium, and large views.</p>
      <p>We want to let people know where we have locations and invite them to make a reservation.	We also want to inform potential clients of the weather in specified locations and any weather reports that may be active in the area. We will have contact information for the temples we are close to and let clients know of that we have shuttle services available. We want to make it easy to book a room with a simple secure form.</p>
